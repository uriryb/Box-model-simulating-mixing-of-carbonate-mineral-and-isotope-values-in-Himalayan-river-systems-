Readme File

This package contains sources and supporting function/data files to predict the carbonate mineral and isotope (d18O, d13C and clumped) values of sediment in Himalayan River systems.
As part of a paper "Late Miocene uplift and exhumation of the Lesser Himalaya recorded by clumped isotope compositions of detrital carbonate" by U. Ryb, C. Ponton, C. France-Lanord, K. Yoshida, and J. M. Eiler.
For further details, please see Note S1 in the supplementary material file of the manuscript.

This package contains:
1) Matlab source code (detrital_carbonate_budget.m)
2) Associated functions(mix.m, Magali_D47.m, Magali_Temp.m, VPDBtoVSMOW.m, VSMOWtoVPDB.m)
3) .XLS source files with empirical data (BoB_data_Calcite_Turb.xls)

The script is run from the sources code. Different scenarios described in the manuscript, can be selected by commenting/uncommenting sections in the source code.
